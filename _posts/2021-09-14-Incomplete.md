Title: "Incomplete"
Published: true

I’ve been working through some anxiety and depression recently. I work with a coach through [Daydreamers](https://www.daydreamerspace.com) and my coach asked today what’s going through my mind in the moment when I decide to pick up my phone and scroll. My answer? “Being done with a task and not feeling like I want to start something new.” Which like, is true. But also, it seems like the solution is right there. 

What if I don’t have to start something, or finish something? That’s definitely one of the things that’s appealing about a feed. It’s curated, you look at it as long as you want, and then you stop. My goal for this week is to specifically seek out ways to leave creative, relaxing endeavors open to come back to later. 


Options:
- reading a book
- coloring/drawing
- finding some quick meditations
- stepping outside
- re-inking a linoleum block
- praying
- playing with my cats

None of these are commitments to an immediate product. Or at least they don’t have to be.
