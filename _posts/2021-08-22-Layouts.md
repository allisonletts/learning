Title: "Layouts"

I like this template as a starting point. I forked somersault/texture and then copied over the files in `_layouts`. I looked at the way the navbar was set up and realized that it needed info in `_config.yml`. 

The navbar links need to point to the right file **name**, but not include the file **extension**. If I set the navbar url to Reading-List.md, it serves an i formatted MD file. So just Reading-List it is.
