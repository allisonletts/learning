Title: "Learning to Row"
Published: true

One thing I’ve been saying a lot recently is, “I’m a consultant. It’s my job to learn new things.” See also: “Learning new things is one of my favorite things to do.”

At the beginning of this month, I took a Learn to Row class with my husband and my twin (and seven other newbies). With the help of a kind, patient, dedicated, optimistic, and helpful group of 20+ volunteers, we went from never putting an oar in the water to actually **rowing** the boats over the course of four sessions. 

I just got home from a one-on-one mentoring session. The first time I worked with this mentor, on day one, I had such a hard time in her boat. I attributed it to her, not to me. Having just worked with her again, I have to say that there was something else going on: the context. 

I’m used to learning quickly. My brain can move quickly, and I pick up new vocabulary words easily, so I feel like I’m able to make meaningful progress without a whole lot of hassle up front. My brain does not do as good of a job when it’s trying to get my **body** to do a brand new thing. I have to explain the thing to my body several times, or see it a bunch, and rowing is a lot about the feeling, not seeing or describing. 

So, context. Three weeks in, I’ve felt at least a few good strokes—how the oar feels when it drops into the water just the right amount, and how my body can pull my arms along for most of the stroke. I have some points of reference. With usable points of reference, this mentor was truly phenomenal. She helped me understand more of what to do to make each stroke better. For me, right now, that’s the following:
1. Tap down just before the oars touch my body. I want to be able to push my hands directly down, not scoop them forwards again to get around my belly. 
1. Feather with the top two segments of my fingers, not really with my wrists. 
1. Square with the third segments of my fingers. 
1. Keep the oars in the water. Don’t row out. Let the oars stay where they want to be. 
1. Don’t start feathering until the oars are out of the water. 
1. Don’t start rowing until the oars are square and in the water. 
1. Backing is about precision, often. Stop and think. Flip the oars inwards and then skim on the way back. 

How can I get more context for physical activity more quickly? What will help with proprioception and understanding what’s going on just by hearing it described?
