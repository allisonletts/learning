- SFDX
  - new org, new client, want to take advantage of stuff we’ve already built. What steps do I need to take?
  - where do I find stuff we’ve already done?
  - how do I incorporate stuff we’ve done?
  - I’ve developed some repurposable stuff. How do I bring it into the repo? How does packaging tie in?
  - client has an existing org who wants to get their shit together—already has a deployment pipeline with changesets. How get under control? In a way that’s conducive for team development?
  - source code is really cool when there’s source code. What about things that are just metadata, like flows or lightning components? Can more than one person work on a flow? Does it help or inhibit that?
  - what does the development pipeline look like when there’s a single huge flow per object?
  - tdtm as the plan for managing automatic updates
  - flow async: makes setup and tear down of flow interpreter less bad
  - logic in apex and business rules in flows, or somewhere else that analysts can get into
  - one person responsible for layout
