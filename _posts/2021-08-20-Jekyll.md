I'm guessing this will be far easier than google. [Here's my practice repo](https://github.com/allisonletts/github-pages-with-jekyll)

## The big breakthrough
There is only a small list of Jekyll themes supported by GitHub pages, and only some of **those** are blog-enabled. Updating to the hacker theme should do it.

**Update** the Hacker theme didn't do the trick. I was mistaken, and it wasn't blog-enabled. I figured out that remote_theme in ```_config.yml``` gives you access to the rest of the themes hosted on GitHub. I've landed on [**Texture**](https://github.com/samarsault/texture) because it has enough features that it basically does what I want, but not so many features that I can hyperfixate for toooo long. I found it on http://jekyllthemes.org/
