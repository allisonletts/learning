Title: "Working Copy and Shortcuts"
---

So now that I have a place to write, I want a place to do it. I don’t currently have a personal computer, so I spend a lot of time with other people’s computers or my work computer. That means that a lot of my day-to-day activity happens on my phone. I was already feeling a little irritated with setting up blog posts manually, so a long car ride was a great opportunity to create a shortcut to write posts from my phone. 

I’m a firm believer in Apple Shortcuts. This one requires the paid ($20/lifetime) version of Working Copy if you want to be able to push the file back up to a remote. It asks for a title, and then it sets up all of the needed metadata and opens the file up in Working Copy. 

- Prompt for title
- Set up front matter, with layout of Post
- Hyphenate title
- Set file name to properly formatted date plus hyphenated title 
- Set Path to _posts/filename.md
- Write file to local repo
- open file in Working Copy


[Here’s the shortcut (not updated).](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7d57752f307c4f39b227016cc87a44b8) It references my repo, and publishes to the checked out branch. 

I got this post set up using it.
