title: "Progress check: SQL"
---

Today was a day of SQL, mostly. I've worked with databases through code before--C# in high school, Apex now--and I've been able to do some basic operations in SQL if needed (with a healthy dose of googling and [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)), but I haven't needed to dive into it **hard** before. So... now's the time.

I'm consistently working through joins, but I'm maxing out at about three tables. I don't really understand subqueries yet. I also occasionally get turned around by my primary database being Salesforce, and how it operates under completely different rules.

Today, I finally figured out what I was missing with expressions. At least in Heidi, I need to enter a formula that would work in a query into the ```Expression``` column and then set the ```Virtuality``` to _Persistent_ or _Virtual_. If I set it to persistent, it evaluates the formula once and then goes back to being a regular column. If it's virtual, it gets evaluated each time, like a formula in Salesforce.

I also got to put ```coalesce()``` and ```nullif()``` into action, which felt pretty cool.
